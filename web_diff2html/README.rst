Diff To HTML
============

Converts diff output of a field value to prettified HTML.
(e.g. as seen on github, bitbucket etc.).

Usage:

* Field must be of `HTML` type.
* Set `widget="diff2html"` on field where it is defined in a form view.

This module uses `diff2html`_ as a base library to generate HTML diff.

*This a sample diff2html implementation in Odoo using this widget:*
